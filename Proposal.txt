Overview & Motivation:
  Those who have Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) do not produce insulin. While this is mainly diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults, it
  actually can develop at any age (https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/what-is-type-1-diabetes.html). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is classified by reduced insulin
  production. This type is usually diagnosed in older adults, but like T1D it can also be diagnosed at any age (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type
  -2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193).
  
  Both of us were interested in exploring methylation differences and its contribution to disease. We chose diabetes because we are curious to see if alternative
  methylation is a main factor in differential insulin production (producing none at all, very little, and a normal amount). We would also like to note that the
  Lynes lab at UConn has studied, to some extent, how specific antibodies can diminish the severity of both T1D and T2D.

Initial Questions:
  1.) What are the differences in DNA methylation patterns in subjects with T1D and healthy individuals (control)?
  2.) What are the differences in methylation patterns between subjects with T1D versus T2D?
  3.) Are there differences in the accumulation of alternative methylations that are age-dependent? Does this change with age of onset / diagnosis?
  4.) Do specific CpG islands accumulate methylation changes faster than others? If so, what genes are nearby?
  5.) Is there a correlation between increased methylation and decreased insulin production?
  6.) How can we assess the accuracy and/or completeness of the data using tools we have learned in class?
   
Data:
  Most likely going to look at least two of the following sets:
  1.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds?Db=gds&DbFrom=bioproject&Cmd=Link&LinkName=bioproject_gds&LinkReadableName=GEO+DataSets&ordinalpos=1&IdsFromResult=124181
  2.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds?Db=gds&DbFrom=bioproject&Cmd=Link&LinkName=bioproject_gds&LinkReadableName=GEO+DataSets&ordinalpos=1&IdsFromResult=244074
  3.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds?Db=gds&DbFrom=bioproject&Cmd=Link&LinkName=bioproject_gds&LinkReadableName=GEO+DataSets&ordinalpos=1&IdsFromResult=597238
  4.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds?Db=gds&DbFrom=bioproject&Cmd=Link&LinkName=bioproject_gds&LinkReadableName=GEO+DataSets&ordinalpos=1&IdsFromResult=125195
  5.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds?Db=gds&DbFrom=bioproject&Cmd=Link&LinkName=bioproject_gds&LinkReadableName=GEO+DataSets&ordinalpos=1&IdsFromResult=126501

Workflow / Analysis:
  -Finalize which data will be used
  -Potentially use R to analyze / view Illumina data from published studies
  -Decide on which R packages will be best to analyze data, create charts, etc.
  -Develop user-friendly graphic to display differences
  -Analyze accuracy / completeness of data
