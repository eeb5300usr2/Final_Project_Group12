Subject ID 11748-0 at disease time points 2-5, Female, age range ~0-11 years


Overview & Motivation:
  Those who have Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) do not produce a sufficient amount of insulin. While this is mainly diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults, it
  actually can develop at any age (https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/what-is-type-1-diabetes.html). 

Initial Questions:
  1.) What are the differences in DNA methylation patterns in subjects with T1D and healthy individuals (control)?
  2.) How can we assess the accuracy and/or completeness of the data using tools we have learned in class?
  3.)

Data:
  Currently working this out -- trying to finalize where data will come from and what exactly we want to use.

Workflow / Analysis:
  -Potentially use R to analyze / view Illumina data from published study
  -Develop user-friendly graphic to display differences
  -Analyze accuracy / completeness of data
